# 3. Discussion Topics
  - Discussed ONC 2015 certification, which is now complete. Can view certification on [CHPL website](https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/listing/10938). Plan to release OpenEMR 7.0.0 this weekend, which will be a ONC 2015 certified release!!!
    - Discussed allowing other organizations to white label the certification. SLI charges $500 for this and likely will then require yearly maintenance fee and real world testing to maintain it (will confirm this with SLI). At next board meeting will discuss if OpenEMR Foundation will allow this and if so, will discuss what the OpenEMR Foundation will charge.
  - Discussed fundraising.
    - Working on getting listed on https://www.charitynavigator.org/
  - Discussed professional support wiki page, which Sherwin continues to clean up.

# 4. Adjourn
  - The next Monthly OpenEMR Foundation Board meeting will be held on August 10, 2022.
  - Meeting adjourned at 21:40 Eastern Daylight Time by Stephen Waite.
